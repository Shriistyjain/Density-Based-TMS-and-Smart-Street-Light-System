# Density-Based-TMS-and-Smart-Street-Light-System
This project is an automated system designed to improve traffic flow and enhance street lighting using real-time data. By detecting traffic density at signals and on roadways with IR sensors, and integrating smart street lights controlled by Arduino, the system provides a seamless and eco-friendly solution for both civilians and technicians. The data is also analyzed.

Key Features
1. Traffic Density Detection: Utilizes IR sensors to monitor traffic density at signals and on roadways.
2. Smart Street Lights: Integrates LEDs controlled by Arduino to adjust street lighting based on traffic conditions.
3. Real-time data about the density of roads in plotted that can be further help in city development.
4. Eco-Friendly Solution: Optimizes traffic flow and street lighting to reduce energy consumption and emissions.
5. User and Technician Friendly: Provides a reliable and efficient system that benefits both civilians and technicians.
Components
IR Sensors: Detect the density of traffic at intersections and along road paths.
Arduino: Acts as the central controller, processing data from the IR sensors and managing the LEDs for smart street lighting.
LEDs: Used for street lights, these are controlled by the Arduino to adjust brightness based on traffic conditions.
